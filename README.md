# 🕵️‍♂️ Spectra

**Spectra** is my personal **learning playground** — a project and repository where I explore what’s possible using different programming languages and tools, starting with Python but eventually expanding to others like JavaScript, C++, Bash, and more.

## 📚 About This Project

I’m currently **learning as I go**, experimenting with different system-level interactions and functionalities. The focus began with Python, but the vision has grown — **Spectra will evolve into a multi-language toolkit and learning hub**.

This includes building, testing, and understanding things like:

- Accessing and listing files  
- Recording audio from the microphone  
- Capturing webcam images  
- Taking screenshots  
- Monitoring system resources (CPU, RAM, battery, etc.)  
- Exploring network-related features  
- CLI tools, GUI tools, automations, and low-level scripting

Each feature is here to help me **understand how far I can go with code**, while staying within ethical and legal boundaries.

## 🛠️ Built With

- **Languages:**
  - Python 3.x (primary focus for now)
  - Bash, C++, JavaScript (coming soon)

- **Python Libraries:**
  - `os`, `sys`
  - `sounddevice`
  - `opencv-python`
  - `pyautogui`
  - `psutil`
  - And more as needed

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This is an evolving project — parts of it may break, change, or even be moved into other focused repositories as I grow and learn.

For now, Spectra is a **sandbox for experiments, projects, and system-level learning**.

---

## 💡 Future Possibilities

- Network monitoring and tools  
- VM and environment detection  
- Ethical keylogging / process watching (on my own system only)  
- Custom command-line interfaces or dashboards  
- Alert and logging systems  
- Cross-platform experiments

---

## 🧪 Why Spectra?

Because learning by building is the best way. And every experiment — even if it fails — teaches something valuable.

---

## 🙌 Acknowledgment

Inspired by curiosity, systems programming, and a desire to understand how real tools and operating systems work behind the scenes.

## 📦 Note

This is **not a polished product**, but a **developer’s lab**. Sub-repos and separate projects may be created from here as I learn and grow — eventually merging useful features into larger tools or platforms.

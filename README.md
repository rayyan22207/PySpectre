# 🕵️‍♂️ Spectra

**Spectra** is a personal Python project created to explore how much access Python can have to system resources like files, audio, video, and system monitoring — all for **learning purposes only**.

## 📚 About This Project

I'm currently **learning as I go** — adding features step-by-step while understanding how everything works. This project may eventually include:

- Accessing and listing files
- Recording audio from the microphone
- Capturing webcam images
- Taking screenshots
- Monitoring system resources (CPU, RAM, battery, etc.)
- Exploring network-related tasks later on

Each feature is meant to help me **understand the power and limits of Python** when interacting with an operating system.
